Many websites are vulnerable to well-known and widely available hacking technology.  

* The Fortress exists as a demonstration of how this can be prevented by:
    * Input validation
    * Session management
    * Database encryption
    * Separation of duties
    * Strict coding standard
    * Comments striped from files sent to the client, before deployment.

Note that although The Fortress has a military theme, it is not a command and control
simulation.  If it were, there would need to be non-commissioned officers and some
way of simulating ranks above Captain.  For The Fortress, data is simply a goal to
defend, so three ranks (Private, Lieutenant and Captain) are enough.
