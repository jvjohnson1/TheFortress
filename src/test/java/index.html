  <h1>It is legal to hack this site, but please play nice!</h1>
  <p>We are programming students studying how to make websites secure.  As part of our training, we allow this test site to be attacked,
  to learn what is working and what vulnerabilities remain.  Hack away, but please do not deface the site with offensive material.</p>

      <img src="images/kiddie.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <p>If you're testing as part of our class, a basic username and password have been provided.  For others, there is a user with a common name and a
      password that will be included in any test wordlist worth running.  Regardless of how you gain access, this account has very limited priviliges.  Beyond that, you
      are on your own.</p>

      <h3 class="feature-title">If you are a hardened cyber-criminal - </h3>
      <img src="images/criminal.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <p>You will probably get in if you try, because we are students and the security we are learning is still incomplete.  You have nothing to
      gain though.  All that's here is test data, which has no meaning except as a goal for us to defend.</p>

      <h6 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Additional Information</h6>
      <p>This is not an intentionally-vulnerable site like The Bodget Store.  We have a lot to learn, but we except for the one soft user account mentioned in the
      hint, we are making this site as stong as we can.</p>
      <p>It will get stronger as the semester progresses, and we completely renew every few days, so if you manage to create a new user, the account will not
      last.  Backdoors will vanish as well</p>
      <p>You may be detected and possibly identified.  The security skills we are learning include the ability to trace an attack, so that a criminal who attacked
      a production site could be prosicuted.  However, hacking this test site is not a crime, so we won't make use of tracing information for any purpose beyond
      classroom exercises.  However, if you want to keep your hacking games a secret, you have been warned!</p>

      <h6 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Find the contact info!</h6>
      <p>There is a working contact email address hidden in the test data.  If you find it, go ahead and shoot me an email saying how you got in! But
      please be polite and don't spam us!.</p>
