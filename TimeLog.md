I didn't really track time in week 1, although I did about 90 minutes today, getting
the indie project created in Maven and pushed up to github.  So far, so good, especially
given that this is Week 2 work, and Week 1 isn't due yet, so I'm ahead of the class
timeline.
I made no effort to track hours before today, but I guessimate six hours outside class
between when Enterprise Java came up in blackboard and last night, inclusive.
I'll keep better track of time after this.
