* Week 1
    * I didn't really track time in week 1, although I did about 90 minutes today, getting
the indie project created in Maven and pushed up to github.  So far, so good, especially
given that this is Week 2 work, and Week 1 isn't due yet, so I'm ahead of the class
timeline.
* Week 2
    * I made no effort to track hours before today, but I guessimate six hours outside class
between when Enterprise Java came up in blackboard and last night, inclusive.
I'll keep better track of time after this.
* Week 3
    * Actually worked vary stead this week, about 90 minutes a day, although I didn't log
details day by day.  I'm spending a lot of time researching how to make encryption
work in a real-world application, and sometimes I think I know too much about the 
encryption standards and not enough about how to make it happen.
